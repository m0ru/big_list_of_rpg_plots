<h2>Good Housekeeping </h2>
<p>The PCs are placed in charge of a large operation (a trading
  company, a feudal barony, the CIA) and must, despite lack of
  experience in such things, make it work and thrive.</p>
<p>
  <em>Common Twists &amp; Themes: </em>The PCs are brought in
  because something big is about to happen, and the Old Guard
  wants a chance to escape. The peasants, neighbors, employees,
  etcetera resent the PCs, because their method of inheritance
  looks outwardly bad and everybody loved the old boss. </p>
